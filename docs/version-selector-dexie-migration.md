# Version Selector Dexie Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to migrate the VersionSelector component from using localStorage to Dexie database for version management.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components
- **VersionSelector.tsx**: UI component that displays save button and version dropdown
- **useVersionManager.ts**: Hook that manages version state and operations using localStorage
- **useLocalStorage.ts**: Low-level hook for localStorage operations

### Current Data Flow
1. User clicks "Save Snapshot" â†’ saves to localStorage with timestamp
2. Version list stored as array in localStorage
3. Selected version loads data from localStorage by timestamp key

### Issues with Current Implementation
- Not integrated with new Dexie architecture
- Uses localStorage which has size limitations
- No version naming capability
- No delete functionality

## New Architecture with Dexie

### Database Schema Changes
Add new `versions` table to existing Dexie database:
```typescript
{
  id: string,          // Auto-generated ID
  handoutType: string, // Type of handout (Newspaper, etc.)
  name: string,        // User-defined version name
  data: any,          // Complete handout data
  timestamp: number,   // Created timestamp
  createdAt: Date     // Creation date
}
```

### Updated Data Flow
1. **Save Version**: Insert new row in `versions` table
2. **Load Version**: Query by ID and update transient record
3. **List Versions**: Query all versions for current handout type
4. **Delete Version**: Remove row from table

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update Database Schema
- Modify `db.ts` to add versions table
- Update Dexie version number
- Add TypeScript types for version records

### 2. Create New useVersionManager Hook
Replace localStorage operations with Dexie:
- `saveVersion(name?: string)`: Create new version record
- `loadVersion(id: string)`: Load version into transient record
- `deleteVersion(id: string)`: Remove version
- `renameVersion(id: string, name: string)`: Update version name
- `useVersionsList()`: React hook for live version list

### 3. Update VersionSelector Component
Enhance UI to support new features:
- Text input for version name when saving
- Display version names in dropdown
- Add delete button for each version
- Show creation date/time
- Confirm dialog for delete operations

### 4. Integration in App.tsx
- Import and render VersionSelector below HandoutTypeSelector
- Pass current handout type and data
- Handle version selection and updates

### 5. Data Migration
Create migration utility for existing localStorage data:
- Check for existing localStorage versions on startup
- Convert to new Dexie format
- Preserve timestamps and data
- Clean up localStorage after successful migration

### 6. Testing Considerations
- Test version save/load/delete operations
- Verify data integrity across version switches
- Test migration from localStorage
- Handle edge cases (corrupt data, missing fields)

## UI/UX Improvements

### Save Dialog
- Modal/inline form for version name
- Default name: "Version saved at [time]"
- Optional description field

### Version List Display
- Show version name (bold)
- Show creation date/time (smaller text)
- Delete button (trash icon)
- Edit name button (pencil icon)

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Confirm before deleting version
- Warn if unsaved changes when switching versions

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Scalability**: IndexedDB has much higher storage limits than localStorage
2. **Performance**: Better query performance for large datasets
3. **Features**: Easier to add search, filtering, sorting
4. **Consistency**: Aligns with rest of app's data architecture
5. **Extensibility**: Can add metadata, tags, sharing in future

## Future Enhancements

- Version comparison/diff view
- Export/import versions
- Version tagging/categorization
- Auto-save functionality
- Version branching/forking
- Collaborative features
