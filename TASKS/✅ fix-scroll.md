# fix-scroll
**Status**: Complete

## Overview
Fix CSS scroll issue where the form has a scrollbar but cannot actually scroll down, even though it appears the content should be scrollable.

## Task Context
- Form system is in `src/FormRenderer.tsx` with components in `src/components/`
- Desktop layout has left sidebar with `overflow-y-scroll` (mentioned in `./CLAUDE/mobile-ui.md`)
- Mobile uses drawer system, desktop has always-visible sidebar
- Main layout structure is in `src/App.tsx`
- Custom CSS in `index.css` and potentially Tailwind classes causing the issue

## Blockers/Issues
None currently

## TODO
[X] Identify which element is preventing scrolling
    [X] Check App.tsx for main layout structure
    [X] Inspect FormRenderer component for overflow issues
    [X] Look for conflicting CSS classes or styles
[X] Fix the CSS/layout issue causing the scroll problem
