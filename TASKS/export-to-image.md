# export-to-image
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview
We need to add a feature where the user can click a floating button to export the current renderer handout as an image to the clipboard. The button should be similar to the existing background selector button but positioned in the bottom right of the render area. The feature will capture the DOM content of the renderer and convert it to an image using canvas, then copy it to the clipboard.

## Task Context
- The floating button should be similar to the background selector button in `src/BackgroundSelector.tsx` which uses a fixed/absolute positioned button with hover and active states
- Background selector uses Valtio state management (`appState.ts`) for its open/closed state
- The render area content is in `.render-area-content` element - we need to export its first child (or wrap multiple children in a div)
- All renderer components are in `src/renderer/` and render handout data as visual output
- Framework: React 19 with TypeScript, Valtio for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling
- We'll need to use HTML-to-canvas conversion (likely html2canvas library or similar) to capture DOM as image
- Then use Clipboard API to copy the canvas image to clipboard

## Work Log
[2025-09-06] Implemented export image feature with clipboard functionality
- Files created: src/ExportImageButton.tsx
- Files modified: src/App.tsx, package.json
- Installed html2canvas library for DOM to image conversion
- Created floating button component with loading states and success feedback
- Implemented clipboard API with fallback to download if clipboard not supported
- Positioned button in bottom-right corner of render area to match design pattern of other floating controls

[2025-09-07] Fixed export issues with NewspaperClipping component
- Added html-to-image library for better CSS support
- Updated ExportImageButton.tsx to try html-to-image first, fallback to html2canvas
- html-to-image uses SVG foreignObject which has better support for CSS filters and background-blend-mode
- Added console logging to track which library is being used
- Improved error handling and cleanup for temporary wrapper elements
